        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. 
            Add shells and cook, stirring occasionally, 
            until almost tender, about 7 minutes. 
            Scoop out 1/2 cup cooking water; set aside. 
            Drain pasta in a colander. 
            Return to pot and toss with 1 tablespoon oil.
            Meanwhile, heat remaining 3 tablespoons oil 
            in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. 
            Add sirloin and sausage and cook, undisturbed, 
            until bottom side is lightly browned, 
            about 6 minutes. Stir, and continue to cook, 
            stirring and breaking up meat into smaller 
            pieces with a wooden spoon, 
            until cooked through, about 4 minutes</p>
        <p>To assemble, spread about 2 cups of the ragu 
            in the bottom of a 13- x 9-inch baking dish. 
            Spoon 1/2 of the pasta over sauce. Dollop half 
            of the ricotta mixture over pasta, and sprinkle 
            with 1 cup mozzarella cheese. Spoon remaining 
            pasta over mozzarella cheese. Spread remaining 
            ragu over pasta mixture, and dollop with 
            remaining ricotta mixture. Top with remaining 
            1/2 cup mozzarella cheese. Cover lasagna with a 
            large sheet of aluminum foil that's been lightly 
            sprayed with cooking spray (to prevent 
            the cheese from sticking to it).</p>
